*Keyboard shortcuts / hotkeys for VIZ.com's manga reader (regular manga & Shounen Jump)*

## About
Trying to read manga on the VIZ website, but annoyed by the lack of keyboard shortcuts? This extension adds some useful hotkeys to improve your reading experience, especially if you don't have arrow keys. You can also rebind them now using the <sup>experimental</sup> options feature! As of the latest release, the defaults are: 
* NEXT PAGE (A) / PREVIOUS PAGE (D)
* NEXT CHAPTER (E) / PREVIOUS CHAPTER (Q)
* SINGLE COLUMN MODE (S)
* TOGGLE FULLSCREEN WITH IMMERSIVE MODE (F)
* TOGGLE POPOUT (P)
* SCROLL WHEEL PAGE NAVIGATION (UP -> Next, DOWN -> Previous)

## Optional Features
* Automatically activate popout mode when you load a page (*)
* Automatically activate single column mode when you load a page (*)
* Automatically load the next chapter after you reach the final page (*Shounen Jump only*) (*)
* Enable immersive mode when you hit the fullscreen key (*)
* Reverse scroll wheel navigation direction

(*) Enabled by default. You can turn these settings off in the options menu, which can be reached by clicking on the extension's icon in your browser. If that doesn't work, you can open it by right-clicking the extensionâ€™s icon in most Chromium-based browsers and hitting 'Options'.
